<h1>MOTIS 2 API</h1>

<p>Transitous provides the MOTIS 2 API. It is the first stable and versioned MOTIS API, and is incompatible with previous development versions of the API.</p>

<p>Our API endpoint is located at <code>https://api.transitous.org/api/v1/</code>.</p>

<h2>Legacy API (MOTIS 0.x)</h1>

<p>For a few more weeks, the legacy API is available at <code>https://routing.spline.de/api/</code> for compatibility with apps that have not been updated yet.</p>

<p>It will be shut down 1 month after the deployment of MOTIS 2.</p>

<p>The data on the legacy server is no longer kept up to date.</p>
